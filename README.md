# Terraform AWS VPC Setup

## Overview

This Terraform project is designed to set up a basic AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with associated resources, including public and private subnets, an Internet Gateway, and route tables. The setup also includes default Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) associated with the subnets.

## Features

- **VPC**: Creates a VPC with a customizable CIDR block.
- **Public Subnet**: A subnet that automatically assigns public IP addresses to instances launched within it.
- **Private Subnet**: A subnet for instances that do not require direct access to the Internet.
- **Internet Gateway**: Provides a gateway to the internet for the public subnet.
- **Route Tables**: Public and private route tables with appropriate routing for internet access (public) and internal communication (private).
- **NACL Associations**: Associates the default Network ACL with the public and private subnets.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following:

- **Terraform**: Installed and configured on your machine. [Install Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)
- **AWS CLI**: Installed and configured with your AWS credentials. [Install AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- **AWS Account**: You need an AWS account to create and manage AWS resources.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Initialize Terraform**

   Initialize the Terraform working directory. This will download the necessary providers.

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

3. **Review the Configuration**

   Inspect the `main.tf` file to ensure the configuration aligns with your requirements. You can modify the CIDR blocks or other parameters as needed.

4. **Apply the Configuration**

   Apply the Terraform configuration to create the resources. Terraform will show you a plan of what will be created. Type `yes` to confirm.

   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

5. **Destroy the Configuration (Optional)**

   If you need to tear down the infrastructure, you can run:

   ```bash
   terraform destroy
   ```

## File Structure

- `main.tf`: Contains the Terraform configuration for the VPC, subnets, route tables, Internet Gateway, and NACL associations.

## Notes

- **Cost**: Running this configuration will incur costs on AWS. Ensure you monitor your usage to avoid unexpected charges.
- **Customization**: You can customize the CIDR blocks, region, and other parameters in `main.tf` according to your requirements.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, consider the following:

- Ensure your AWS credentials are correctly configured.
- Double-check the CIDR blocks to avoid conflicts.
- Verify the Terraform version you are using is compatible with your configuration.
